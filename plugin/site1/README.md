## üîê Authentication for Restricted Applications

If you want to restrict access to your dashboard (for sensitive, internal, or private data), you can use the **Pacific Ocean Portal Authentication Mechanism**. This system integrates seamlessly with your dashboard and provides:

- User login & session management
- Role-based access controls
- Secure API integration

**How to enable authentication:**
1. Contact the Pacific Ocean Portal team to register your dashboard.
2. Integrate the authentication hooks and config into your Next.js project (see the template for starter code).
3. Deploy your dashboard with authentication enabled.
